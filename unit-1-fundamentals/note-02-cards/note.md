# Cards & Resources

*What Cards represent in Tutors*

## Cards

The card metaphor is used throughout tutors as a simple visual feature to represent a variety of learning resources. In general the contents of a card are extracted from the following:

- A Markdown file, containing resource title + short summary
- An image, in png, jpg, gif or svg formats.

The title, image and summary will be presented on the card, along with a suitable icon.

The Learning resources are typically named to match the context, and are contained in a folder whose name is structured to encode the type of learning resource.

### Resource Names

Folder names convey the type of learning resource contained in the folder, with the first letters determining its type. Folders starting with the following names have a significance in Tutors:

 To sort the name alphabetically you may append numerals. To enhance meaning, append contextual keywords. For example:

| Folder Name            |
| ---------------------- |
| topic-01-introduction  |
| topic-02-learning-html |

For all file & folder names, avoid spaces within a file name.

| Do                     | Don't
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| topic-01-introduction  | Topic 01 Introduction
| topic-02-learning-html | Topic 02 Learning HTML

## Image resizing

Some images you mau choose to use may be hi-resolution, appearing to be super sized on the canvas. This can be a particular issue with screen shots. This service here:

- <https://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo>

Allows you to resize the image to a suitable 'canvas' size.
