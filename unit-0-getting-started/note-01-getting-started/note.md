# Getting Started

*The basic model of Tutors*

Tutors is a collection of open source components and services supporting the creation of transformative learning experiences using open web standards. It consists of two key components:

- *Generator:*  transforms a [folder of learning content](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-reference-course)  into a Tutors course

- *Reader*: presents a Tutors course as an intuitive, discoverable and attractive [Web experience](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course)

These components are [developed in the open](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors) by an active and friendly community, based on a clear [set of values](https://next.tutors.dev/note/tutors-reference-manual/side-unit-4-ref/note-12-values).

### First Course

Visit [this course](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-starter-course) to become familiar with the general structure of the learning experience. [Download the source](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for the course and unzip to a local folder. Spend a few minutes exploring the content of the folder using a good editor, for example [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Install the LTS version [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on your computer and create a free account on the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) service.

### Publish

Open a [command prompt/terminal at the course folder](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/) you created above and enter the following command:

~~~bash
npx tutors-publish
~~~

This should generate a response like this (shortened here):

~~~text
tutors-publish: 3.3.1
: tutors-starter :  Tutors Starter
--: topic-01 :  Simple Units
----: unit-1 : Main Lesson
------: book-a :  Objectives
------: talk-1-intro : Lecture 1
------: talk-2-explore : Lecture 2
----: unit-2 : Supporting Resources
------: archive : Resource 1
------: note-1 :  Note 1
------: web-1 : Web Site 1
...
----: unit-2 : Unit 6 Title
------: talk-1 : Lecture 10
------: web-1 : Zoom Morning Room
------: web-2 : Podcast
tutors-publish: 3.3.1
~~~

A new folder called **json** will be generated by the above command. Drag & Drop this **json folder** to Netlify using this [drop target site](https://app.netlify.com/drop/) (assuming you are logged in to Netlify) . This will publish the course on the web, generating a unique url which you can verify almost immediately.  You can [customise the free domain name](https://stevemats.medium.com/how-to-rename-netlifys-default-subdomain-name-e2d493e40d6e) directly on Netlify.

If you make any changes to the course source folder, then you must proceed through the generation (_npx tutors-publish_) and publishing (drag & drop) to redeploy the course. Be sure to overwrite the existing course on Netlify, unless you want a new course. In this case, locate the deployment panel for the newly created project on Netlify and drag & drop the json folder there.

### Alternative Static Site Publish

There is secondary publication mechanism, which is invoked as above, but with a different command:

~~~bash
npx tutors-publish-html
~~~

This will also generate a folder of content in the course folder - this time in a **html** subfolder. You can open this folder and load the **index.html** therein in a browser (generally just double click). This will open a local version of the course offline (on your workstation only). This does not provide the complete tutors experience, but can be a useful as a backup, an alternative UX and also perhaps as the basis for an archive of the course that can be distributed as a zip file (compress and distribute the html folder only) when a course concludes. The archive can be opened by the students independently, with all course assets held locally, except for videos. The **html** folder can also be published to any web server, including Netlify using the same process as outlined above.

### More Course Examples

The first course example above is a typicaly tutors course, with a basic structure. This example:

- [Alternative Layouts](/course/layout-reference-course)

... incorporates different layouts + nesting of learning objects in various confurations. Download the source [here](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/layout-reference-course/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) 


This example is a complete reference course illustrating all Tutors features:

- [Reference Course](/course/reference-course)
