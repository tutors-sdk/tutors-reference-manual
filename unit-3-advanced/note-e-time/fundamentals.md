# Tutors Time

Exploring Tutors interaction patterns

With authentication enabled, the user will be required to authenticate using a pre-existing GitHub account. Tutors will then record how much time each view is active (in minutes) and send this to the TutorsTime data store. This can be viewed via the TutorsTime feature on the course Navigator. This data is available to  student + the instructor of the course, but not to other students. No other data is gathered, nor is this data transmitted anywhere other than the TutorsTime data store. 

This data is gathered largely for course management purposes. For example, time spent on lab steps is valuable intelligence that will feed into the design of the labs. Also, averaged lab times across the course can help course authors better understand course load and relative load across modules.

The numbers presented are an estimate of the number of minutes the lab is visible in the browser - excluding when the browser is minimised or in an inactive tab.

## TutorsLive

A companion to Tutors Time, this feature lists the students currently interacting with a module. The purpose of the feature is to simulate the presence dimension of a typical timetabled 'practical' in traditional module delivery. In a practical session, students often work on their lab materials in a single physical space. They may work alone or collaborate - but they are at least aware of others in the room, and might have a general idea as to what fellow students are working on.

This experience can generate a sense of community and collective effort. It can also offer opportunities for mutual learning. Starting from from when you visit the course web - Tutors Live will list students who are interacting with the course - at topic level or below. It will list the topic name + the lab if interacting with a lab.

The display starts when you visit course web. No interaction data is shown prior to this time. If no activity is detected for 5 minutes, then the entry for the student is removed from the display. There is a checkbox to opt out - in this case you will not appear in the live display until you check it again. This will not affect other metrics.
